This command creates a configuration file, `config.yaml` in a folder `.spk`
under your home directory. There are two options for creating this file

1. an interactive mode where you have to answer a few questions; and
2. you provide a `yaml` file and this `yaml` will be copied to the target
   location.

## Example

```
spk init --interactive
```

or

```
spk init --file myConfig.yaml
```
