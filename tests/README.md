# Integration Testing SPK

This directory contains shell scripts that execute on a build agent and run
`spk` commands. An [Azure DevOps pipeline yaml](../smoke-test-pipeline.yml) file
scheduled the run of these tests. The yaml file orchestrates the download the
lastest master branch build artifact of `spk` on a daily basis and running smoke
tests.

`validations.sh`

- This file orchestrates the scenarios and is designed to fail on first error.

`functions.sh`

- This file is has simple functions that are reused by `validations.sh`.

# Scenarios Exercised So Far

- As a developer create a mono-repo and add services
- As a developer create a pipeline from an existing service
- As a devleper create a service revision from an existing service
